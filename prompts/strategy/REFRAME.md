# Reframe the Problem

Paste this when: You're stuck. The obvious solutions aren't working and you need a fresh perspective.

---

## Is This Your Situation?

- [ ] You've tried several approaches and none feel right
- [ ] The problem feels "impossible" or heavily constrained
- [ ] You keep circling back to the same bad options
- [ ] Stakeholders keep rejecting your solutions
- [ ] You're solving symptoms, not the root problem

---

## The Process

### Step 1: State the Current Problem

Write it down exactly as you see it now:

```
CURRENT PROBLEM: [What are you trying to solve?]
CONSTRAINTS: [What limitations are you working within?]
FAILED ATTEMPTS: [What have you tried that didn't work?]
```

### Step 2: Reframe by Changing WHO

Ask: What if this wasn't for your current user?

```
What if this was for:
- A complete beginner vs an expert?
- Someone in a rush vs someone with unlimited time?
- A group vs an individual?
- Someone who HATES this task vs someone who loves it?
- An internal user vs an external customer?
```

Pick the most interesting reframe and describe the solution for THAT user. Does it reveal anything useful for your actual user?

### Step 3: Reframe by Changing WHERE

Ask: What if the context was completely different?

```
What if they were using this:
- On a phone while walking?
- On a massive monitor with full attention?
- In a loud, distracting environment?
- With no internet connection?
- While doing something else simultaneously?
- In public where others can see their screen?
```

Pick one and design for that constraint. What simplifications does it force?

### Step 4: Reframe by Changing WHAT

Ask: What if this wasn't a [current product type] at all?

```
What if instead of a [dashboard/app/form/etc], it was:
- A daily email or notification?
- A conversation with a person?
- A physical object?
- An automated system that needed no UI?
- A single button?
- A report someone else prepares for them?
```

Which reframe makes the core job easier?

### Step 5: Combine Insights

Look at what you discovered:

```
FROM "WHO" REFRAME: [Key insight]
FROM "WHERE" REFRAME: [Key insight]
FROM "WHAT" REFRAME: [Key insight]
```

Now write a NEW problem statement that incorporates these insights:

```
REFRAMED PROBLEM: [New way of seeing it]
NEW SOLUTION DIRECTION: [What to try next]
```

---

## Forcing Function: The Inversion

If you're still stuck, try inverting:

```
Instead of: "How do we get users to [do thing]?"
Ask: "How do we make [thing] unnecessary?"

Instead of: "How do we make this easier?"
Ask: "What would make users WANT to do this?"

Instead of: "How do we add this feature?"
Ask: "What problem are we avoiding by adding features?"
```

---

## Output Format

```
ORIGINAL PROBLEM: [statement]

REFRAMES EXPLORED:
- WHO: [insight]
- WHERE: [insight]
- WHAT: [insight]

REFRAMED PROBLEM: [new statement]

NEW DIRECTIONS TO EXPLORE:
1. [direction]
2. [direction]
3. [direction]
```

## When This Works Best

- Early in a project when the problem isn't well-defined
- When you've hit a wall with conventional approaches
- When constraints feel too tight
- When stakeholder feedback keeps killing solutions

## When to Skip This

- When the solution is obvious and you just need to execute
- When you're optimizing something that already works
- When the problem is purely technical, not conceptual
