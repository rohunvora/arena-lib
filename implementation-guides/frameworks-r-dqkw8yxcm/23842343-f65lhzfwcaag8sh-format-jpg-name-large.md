## Munger's Maxim

## Essence
Significant results often arise not from complex strategies but from relentlessly focusing on a simple, fundamental idea.

## The Framework

### Core Structure
A two-part framework:
1. **Simplicity**: Identify a core, uncomplicated principle or idea.
2. **Conviction**: Commit to that idea with unwavering focus and dedication.

### Key Questions
1. What is the most basic, understandable concept at play here?
2. How can I apply this simple idea with exceptional dedication and persistence?
3. What obstacles might tempt me to abandon this simplicity, and how can I overcome them?

### The Process
1. **Start with**: Identifying a core, simple principle relevant to the problem or opportunity.
2. **Then**: Evaluate your level of conviction in this principle. Can you commit to it fully, even when challenged?
3. **Finally**: Act on this principle with consistent, unwavering focus.

## Use This When
- **Facing complex problems**: Simplicity cuts through the noise.
- **Evaluating new opportunities**: Can this opportunity be reduced to a simple, understandable core?
- **Developing a long-term strategy**: A simple, unwavering focus is easier to maintain over time.

## Avoid This When
- **Dealing with genuinely novel situations**: If no simple analogies or principles apply, this framework is premature.
- **Seeking short-term tactical advantages**: This is about long-term commitment, not quick wins.
- **The core principle is unethical or harmful**: This framework amplifies, not corrects.

## Common Mistakes
- **Mistake**: Confusing "simple" with "easy." A simple idea can require immense effort.
  **Fix**: Acknowledge the challenge; simplicity clarifies the *direction* of effort.
- **Mistake**: Mistaking "simple" for "simplistic".
  **Fix**: The idea should be fundamental and powerful, not shallow or naive.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → For Quick Decisions (< 5 min)
- Identify the single most important factor.
- Ask: "If I focused solely on this, would I succeed?"

### → For Deep Analysis (1+ hour)
- Explore the historical success stories built on this principle.
- Identify potential counter-arguments and develop robust defenses.

### → For Team Settings
- Before brainstorming, have each member identify a single core principle they believe in.
- Facilitate a debate on which principle the team should commit to.

### → Combined With Other Frameworks
- **First Principles Thinking**: Use First Principles to *derive* the simple idea.
- **Occam's Razor**: Use Occam's Razor to *select* the simplest explanation.

## System Prompt Snippet
```
When I ask you to apply Munger's Maxim, follow this process:
1. Identify the most simple, core principle relevant to the situation.
2. Evaluate the potential impact of applying this principle with unwavering focus.
3. Suggest concrete actions based on this principle.

Key questions to address:
- What is the most basic, understandable concept at play here?
- How can I apply this simple idea with exceptional dedication and persistence?

Avoid: Don't suggest superficial or simplistic solutions. Focus on fundamental principles.
```
