## Heroic Explanation

## Essence
Communicating complex value propositions quickly by pairing a clear problem/solution statement with concise feature/benefit explanations.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment
```css
/* Background */
background: white;

/* Containers */  
border-radius: 0px;
box-shadow: none;
border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Light gray border on image containers */

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Clean, minimal containers allow the content to speak for itself */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Simple sans-serif
- Size scale: h1 (32px), h2 (24px), body (16px), labels (12px)
- Weight usage: Bold for headings and key benefits, regular for descriptions.
- Distinctive moves: None evident.
- Color treatment: Primary text is black, secondary/labels are grey.

### Color Logic
- Mode: light
- Background: white
- Text: black (primary), grey (secondary/labels)
- Accent: blue (for primary CTA)
- The rule: Blue is reserved for the primary call to action, creating a clear visual focus.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px
- Gap between elements: 8px-16px between text elements, 24px between sections.
- Chunking strategy: Feature/capability/benefit are grouped together, paired with a visual.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Not applicable
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle, filled with blue, white text.
- **Cards**: Light gray border, minimal padding.
- **Data display**: Not applicable
- **Icons**: Not applicable

## Use This When
- **Explainer pages for SaaS products**: Quickly showcase the value proposition.
- **Landing pages targeting a specific pain point**: Address the problem head-on.
- **Products with complex feature sets**: Breaking down features into benefits.

## Avoid This When
- **Highly visual or artistic brands**: The style is very functional, not expressive.
- **When a premium or luxurious feel is required**: This style is too simple.
- **When visual storytelling is paramount**: The focus is on information, not aesthetics.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Use the color blue to highlight important metrics.
- Add small icons to feature lists to add visual interest.

### → Landing Page
- Add a large hero image related to the core problem.
- Use subtle animations to draw attention to key benefits.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- Mobile: Stack feature/benefit sections vertically.
- Web: Consider a two-column layout to showcase the problem/solution side-by-side.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Background: Change to dark gray (#333).
- Text: Change primary text to white, secondary to light gray.
- Button: Keep blue button but consider a lighter shade for better contrast.
- Shadows: Remove shadows to maintain a flat design.
