## Soft Reveal Mobile

## Essence
Create a sense of anticipation and delight through a clean, minimal interface with subtle animations and tactile metaphors.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: #F7F7F7; /* Light gray background */

/* Containers */
border-radius: 24px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
All elements share rounded corners and a subtle shadow, creating a soft, inviting feel.
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 18px
    - body: 16px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for titles, regular for body text, medium for labels.
- Distinctive moves: None.
- Color treatment: Dark gray for primary text, medium gray for secondary text and labels.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: #F7F7F7
- Text: #222222 (primary), #777777 (secondary)
- Accent: Black or dark gray for primary CTA.
- The rule: Minimal color palette focuses attention on the content and creates a sense of calm.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Minimal
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 24px
- Gap between elements: 16px
- Chunking strategy: Information is grouped into clear sections with ample white space.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: None visible, implied back button.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle with solid fill (black or dark gray).
- **Cards**: Rounded corners, subtle shadow, often used for tactile metaphors (wallet).
- **Data display**: Simple text labels with clear values.
- **Icons**: Thin stroke, minimalist style.

## Use This When
- Onboarding: To create a positive first impression.
- Mobile apps: Due to the clean, focused design.
- Simple data visualization: Where clarity is paramount.
- Products with a sense of discovery: The tactile metaphors and animations enhance the feeling of unveiling something special.

## Avoid This When
- Data-heavy dashboards: The minimalist approach can be overwhelming with lots of information.
- Complex workflows: The simplicity might not be suitable for intricate tasks.
- Situations requiring high contrast: The subtle color palette might not meet accessibility requirements.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Introduce more distinct visual hierarchy with color-coded sections.
- Use a more structured grid layout to accommodate more data.

### → Landing Page
- Use larger, bolder typography to grab attention.
- Incorporate more vibrant accent colors to drive conversions.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- Mobile: Maintain the simplified layout and focus on touch-friendly interactions.
- Web: Utilize larger screen real estate to display more information at once, potentially adding a sidebar navigation.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Background: Change to a dark gray or black.
- Text: Invert text colors to light gray or white.
- Shadows: Remove or adjust shadows to create a subtle glow effect.
