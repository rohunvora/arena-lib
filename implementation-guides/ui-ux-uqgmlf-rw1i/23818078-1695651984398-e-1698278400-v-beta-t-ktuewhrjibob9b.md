## Branching Logic Diagram

## Essence
A clear, hierarchical diagram uses simple shapes and contrasting colors to guide the viewer through a decision-making process.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment
```css
/* Background */
background: #f2f2f2; /* Light gray background */

/* Containers */  
/* In this case, containers are implied by the layout */

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent font and color usage across all elements */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 18px
    - body: 14px
    - labels: 10px
- Weight usage: Regular for most text, bold for emphasis in labels and the main question.
- Distinctive moves: All-caps labels for the "DOESN'T INCLUDE THE PRODUCTS" and "INCLUDES THE PRODUCTS" annotations.
- Color treatment: Primary text is black, secondary is a slightly muted black. Error states are red, confirmation is green, supporting labels are blue.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: #f2f2f2
- Text: Black (#000000) for main text, slightly muted black for less important text.
- Accent: Green for confirmation (checkmark), Red for negative labels, Blue for supporting labels.
- The rule: Color is used sparingly to highlight key decisions and label the nature of each branch.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: Implicit, approximately 16px
- Container padding: N/A
- Gap between elements: Varies based on hierarchy, approximately 32px between top-level options.
- Chunking strategy: Information is grouped hierarchically with clear branching and labels.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Branching diagram with arrows indicating the flow of decision-making.
- **Buttons**: N/A (no interactive buttons)
- **Cards**: N/A (no cards)
- **Data display**: N/A (no data display)
- **Icons**: Small green checkmark icon for confirmation.

## Use This When
Be specific about contexts where this EXCELS:
- **Decision trees**: When visualizing branching logic and decision-making processes.
- **Educational content**: When explaining complex concepts in a simplified, visual manner.
- **Flowcharts**: When mapping out workflows or processes.
- **Presentations**: When highlighting key decision points in a strategy.

## Avoid This When
Be specific about contexts where this FAILS:
- **Data-heavy interfaces**: It's not designed for displaying large amounts of data.
- **Highly interactive interfaces**: It lacks interactive elements beyond simple visual cues.
- **Aesthetic appeal is paramount**: It prioritizes clarity and simplicity over visual flair.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
Specific changes to make this work for data-heavy interfaces:
- Replace text labels with data visualizations (charts, graphs).
- Add interactive filters to allow users to explore different branches based on data.

### → Landing Page
Specific changes for marketing/conversion:
- Replace decision points with calls to action (buttons).
- Use more vibrant colors and imagery to create a visually appealing experience.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
Platform-specific adjustments:
- **Mobile**: Increase font sizes for readability on smaller screens. Stack elements vertically to optimize for single-column layouts.
- **Web**: Utilize larger screen real estate to create a more expansive and detailed diagram.

### → Invert Color Mode
If this is light mode, how to make it dark (or vice versa):
- Invert background color to a dark gray or black (#222222).
- Change text color to white (#FFFFFF).
- Adjust accent colors to maintain contrast and visibility.
- Keep the overall structure and layout the same.
