## Dark Crypto Native

## Essence
Prioritize key financial data and actions with a dark, high-contrast UI that feels modern and secure.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment
```css
/* Background */
background: #1E1E1E; /* A dark gray */

/* Containers */
border-radius: 16px;
box-shadow: none; /* Or a very subtle inner shadow if desired */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - unified by dark background and consistent corner radius */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1 (main balance): 32px
    - h2 (token amounts): 16px
    - body (token names/labels): 14px
    - labels (Deposit/Send): 16px
- Weight usage: Bold for primary numbers, regular for labels and secondary info.
- Distinctive moves: None apparent.
- Color treatment:
    - Primary text: #FFFFFF (white)
    - Secondary text: #BDBDBD (light gray)
    - Muted text: #757575 (medium gray)

### Color Logic
- Mode: dark
- Background: #1E1E1E
- Text: White for primary values, light gray for secondary details.
- Accent: #6750A4 (purple) - used for buttons, and potentially active states.
- The rule: Accent color highlights interactive elements, while text color differentiates data importance.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px internal padding for list items and main container.
- Gap between elements: 8px between text elements, 16px between list items.
- Chunking strategy: Grouping related data (token name, amount, value change) within rounded containers.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar with simple outlined icons.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle with accent color fill and white text. border-radius: 9999px;
- **Cards**: Rounded rectangle containers with internal padding and no border or shadow.
- **Data display**: Large, prominent numerical values for main balance; smaller values for individual token holdings with positive/negative indicators in green/red.
- **Icons**: Simple, filled or outlined icons (depending on context).

## Use This When
- **Crypto wallets**: This style is perfect for displaying financial data in a secure and modern way.
- **Finance apps**: The high contrast and clear typography make it easy to read important numbers.
- **Tech-savvy users**: The dark theme and minimalist design appeal to a modern user base.
- **Mobile-first products**: The layout is optimized for smaller screens and touch interactions.

## Avoid This When
- **Content-heavy applications**: The minimalist design might not be suitable for displaying large amounts of text.
- **Elderly users**: The dark theme and small font sizes might be difficult for some users to read.
- **Light mode is required**: This style is primarily designed for dark mode.
- **Complex data visualization**: If the app requires complex charts or graphs, this style might be too simplistic.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Add subtle shadows to cards for better visual separation: `box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);`
- Use a more structured grid layout for displaying multiple data points.

### → Landing Page
- Incorporate larger, more visually appealing graphics.
- Use the accent color more prominently to draw attention to calls to action.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile:** Increase touch target sizes to at least 44px.
- **Web:** Utilize a sidebar for navigation and display more information at once.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert background to white or light gray (#F5F5F5).
- Change primary text to dark gray (#333333) and secondary text to medium gray (#777777).
- Keep the accent color consistent for brand recognition.
- Remove shadows or use very subtle ones in light mode.
