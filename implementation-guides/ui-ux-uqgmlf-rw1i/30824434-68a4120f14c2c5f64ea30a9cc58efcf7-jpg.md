## Dark Budget Mobile

## Essence
Prioritize clarity and progress on a dark background with rounded cards and a central progress indicator.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: #000000; /* Or a very dark grey #121212 */

/* Containers */
border-radius: 16px;
box-shadow: none; /* Or a very subtle one: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1) */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Dark background + rounded corners everywhere + consistent text treatment*/
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: System sans-serif (clean, readable)
- Size scale:
    - h1 (title): 24px
    - h2 (category): 18px
    - body: 14px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for primary numbers, regular for everything else
- Distinctive moves: None
- Color treatment:
    - Primary: #FFFFFF (white)
    - Secondary: #A3A3A3 (light grey)
    - Muted: #737373 (darker grey)

### Color Logic
- Mode: dark
- Background: Black (#000000)
- Text: White (#FFFFFF) for important data, light grey (#A3A3A3) for labels
- Accent: None specified, could add a small accent to the progress indicator
- The rule: Color is used to create contrast and hierarchy, with white text on the dark background drawing the eye to key metrics.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px
- Gap between elements: 8px between text elements, 16px between cards
- Chunking strategy: Group related information into cards, use whitespace to separate sections.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar with simple outlined icons.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle, filled, text label. border-radius: 8px.
- **Cards**: Rounded rectangle containers with internal padding.
- **Data display**: Large, bold numbers for primary metrics, smaller text for context.
- **Icons**: Simple, outlined icons.

## Use This When
- **Personal finance apps**: The dark mode is easy on the eyes and the layout is clear and concise.
- **Apps with a focus on progress**: The progress indicator is a key element of the design.
- **Simple data visualization**: The design is not overly complex and is easy to understand.
- **Goal tracking**: The progress indicator motivates users to achieve their goals.

## Avoid This When
- **Data-heavy dashboards**: The design is too simple for complex data visualization.
- **Apps with a lot of features**: The design is not flexible enough to accommodate a large number of features.
- **Apps that need to be visually stunning**: The design is functional but not particularly stylish.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Add more visual elements to the data display, such as charts and graphs.
- Use a more complex grid system to accommodate more data.
- Add more color to the design to create visual interest.

### → Landing Page
- Use a hero image to grab the user's attention.
- Add more copy to explain the benefits of the app.
- Use a more prominent call to action.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Stack cards vertically, move nav to bottom. Increase touch targets to 44px.
- **Web**: Use a more complex grid system to take advantage of the larger screen size. Add a sidebar for navigation.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert the background and text colors (white background, dark text).
- Reduce the opacity of the shadows.
- Keep the accent colors the same.
