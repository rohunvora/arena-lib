## Glassy Planner

## Essence
Clean, modern, and approachable, this style uses frosted glass effects and a light color palette to create a sense of calm and clarity.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: #F7F7F7; /* Or a very light gray */

/* Containers */  
border-radius: 20px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);
border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.08);
backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* for glass effect */
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7); /* translucent white for glass */

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent border radius and shadow strength across all containers */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 18px
    - body: 14px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for titles, regular for body text, medium for labels.
- Distinctive moves: Subtle letter-spacing in labels.
- Color treatment:
    - Primary: Dark gray (#333)
    - Secondary: Medium gray (#666)
    - Muted: Light gray (#999)

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: Very light gray (#F7F7F7)
- Text: Dark gray for primary content, medium gray for secondary.
- Accent: Blue (#3B82F6), used sparingly for primary actions and highlights. Orange/Red for notifications.
- The rule: Color is used minimally to guide the eye, with blue indicating interactive elements and orange/red for urgent notifications.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced - not too sparse, not too crowded.
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px
- Gap between elements: 8px - 16px between cards/sections
- Chunking strategy: Group related information within rounded containers, creating clear visual separation.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Not visible, but likely bottom tabs with outlined icons.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangles with blue fill and white text. border-radius: 9999px for pill shape on smaller buttons.
- **Cards**: Rounded containers with subtle shadows, housing related information.
- **Data display**: Large, clear numbers with smaller labels.
- **Icons**: Outlined, medium weight, with rounded corners.

## Use This When
- **Personal productivity apps**: The clean and calming aesthetic is ideal for managing tasks and habits.
- **Health and wellness apps**: The light colors and rounded shapes evoke a sense of positivity and well-being.
- **Apps targeting a younger audience**: The modern and approachable style resonates well with millennials and Gen Z.
- **When you want to convey simplicity and ease of use**.

## Avoid This When
- **Data-heavy dashboards**: The limited color palette and subtle styling may not provide enough visual hierarchy for complex datasets.
- **Apps requiring a sense of urgency or excitement**: The calm aesthetic may not be suitable for fast-paced or high-energy applications.
- **Apps targeting an older demographic**: The small font sizes and subtle styling may be difficult for some users to read and interact with.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Increase the contrast between data elements and the background.
- Use color more strategically to highlight key metrics and trends.
- Add clear visual separators between sections to improve scanability.

### → Landing Page
- Use larger, more prominent typography for headlines and calls to action.
- Incorporate more vibrant imagery and illustrations.
- Add social proof elements, such as testimonials and reviews.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Stack cards vertically, increase touch target sizes to at least 44px, and move navigation to the bottom of the screen.
- **Web**: Utilize a wider layout, add more whitespace, and consider a sidebar navigation.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert the background and text colors (e.g., dark gray background, white text).
- Reduce the strength of the shadows to avoid a harsh appearance.
- Keep the accent color consistent to maintain brand recognition.
