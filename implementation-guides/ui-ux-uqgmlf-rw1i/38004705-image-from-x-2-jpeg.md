## Botanical Clarity

## Essence
Clean typography and circular imagery create a calming, nature-focused interface.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment
```css
/* Background */
background: #FFFFFF; /* Solid white */

/* Containers */  
border-radius: 9999px; /* Pills */
box-shadow: none;
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Circular imagery is consistent across the interface */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Serif for headers, sans-serif for body text.
- Size scale: h1: 24px, h2: 18px, body: 14px, labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for titles, regular for body, lighter for metadata
- Distinctive moves: Pill badges, subtle all-caps labels for metadata.
- Color treatment: Dark grey for primary text, lighter grey for secondary/muted values.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Text: Dark grey (#333333) for primary, grey (#888888) for secondary.
- Accent: Black (#000000) for active states and pill badge backgrounds.
- The rule: Color is used sparingly, with contrast driving hierarchy.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced, with ample whitespace.
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base.
- Container padding: 16px internal padding.
- Gap between elements: 16px between cards/sections.
- Chunking strategy: Information is grouped into clear sections with titles.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Bottom tabs with outlined icons.
- **Buttons**: Pill-shaped, filled with background color on active states.
- **Cards**: Circular images with labels below.
- **Data display**: Simple text labels for metrics.
- **Icons**: Outlined, thin weight.

## Use This When
- **Wellness apps**: The calming aesthetic suits health and wellbeing.
- **Educational apps**: The clarity aids comprehension.
- **Personal organization**: The simplicity promotes focus.
- **Beginner users**: The clear visual hierarchy is easy to navigate.

## Avoid This When
- **Data-heavy dashboards**: Lack of visual differentiation can be overwhelming.
- **E-commerce**: The subtle style may not drive conversions effectively.
- **Gaming**: Lacks the excitement and visual flair needed.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Use charts and graphs within cards to visualize data.
- Add subtle background colors to cards for visual separation.
- Increase font sizes for key metrics.

### → Landing Page
- Use larger, more vibrant imagery.
- Add a prominent call-to-action button with a contrasting color.
- Incorporate testimonials and social proof.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- Mobile: Stack cards vertically, move navigation to bottom.
- Web: Use a wider layout, display more information at once.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert text and background colors (white text on dark grey).
- Adjust shadow values to maintain depth.
- Keep accent color consistent for active states.
