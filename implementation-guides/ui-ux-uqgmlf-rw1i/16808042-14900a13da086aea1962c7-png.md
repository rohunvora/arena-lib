## Dark Metric Pulse

## Essence
A dark-themed dashboard style that uses subtle shadows and bright accents to highlight key metrics and actions, creating a sense of focused energy.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment
```css
/* Background */
background: #121212; /* Dark gray */

/* Containers */
border-radius: 12px;
box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Subtle shadow */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent border-radius and shadow create a card-like feel */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 18px
    - body: 14px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for titles and key metrics, regular for body text, lighter for muted labels.
- Distinctive moves: None apparent.
- Color treatment: Primary text is near-white (#E0E0E0), secondary text is a lighter gray (#A0A0A0), muted labels are a darker gray (#707070).

### Color Logic
- Mode: Dark
- Background: #121212
- Text: #E0E0E0 (primary), #A0A0A0 (secondary)
- Accent: Blue (#3B82F6) for interactive elements and positive indicators, Green (#4CAF50) for positive change, Red (#F44336) for negative change.
- The rule: Accent colors draw attention to key data points and interactive elements, while grayscale values establish a clear information hierarchy.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced - not too sparse, not too crowded.
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px
- Gap between elements: 16px
- Chunking strategy: Information is grouped into cards with clear titles and consistent padding.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Left sidebar with outlined icons and text labels.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle shape, filled with accent color on hover, transparent background with accent color border for secondary actions. Border-radius: 8px.
- **Cards**: Defined by background color, border-radius, and subtle box-shadow.
- **Data display**: Large numerical values with percentage change indicators (green for positive, red for negative). Small sparkline charts provide visual context.
- **Icons**: Outlined, medium weight, accent color for active states.

## Use This When
- **Data dashboards for technical users:** The dark theme reduces eye strain and highlights important metrics.
- **Applications requiring a modern, focused look:** The subtle shadows and bright accents create a sense of energy and clarity.
- **When emphasizing key performance indicators (KPIs):** The color logic effectively draws attention to important data points.
- **When you want an aesthetic that is serious, but not somber.**

## Avoid This When
- **Applications requiring a light and airy feel:** The dark theme can feel heavy in certain contexts.
- **User interfaces with a large amount of text:** Dark themes can reduce readability for extended reading sessions.
- **Applications with complex visualizations:** The limited color palette may not be sufficient for complex charts and graphs.
- **When you need a very friendly, approachable feel.**

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Use larger font sizes for key metrics.
- Implement drill-down functionality for detailed data exploration.
- Add filtering and sorting options for data tables.

### → Landing Page
- Use brighter accent colors to create a more inviting feel.
- Incorporate hero images and large headlines to capture attention.
- Add clear calls to action with prominent button styles.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile:** Move navigation to a bottom tab bar. Increase touch target sizes to at least 44px. Stack cards vertically.
- **Web:** Utilize a multi-column layout. Provide more space for detailed data visualizations.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert background and text colors (dark becomes light, light becomes dark).
- Reduce shadow opacity or remove shadows entirely in light mode.
- Keep accent colors consistent to maintain brand recognition.
