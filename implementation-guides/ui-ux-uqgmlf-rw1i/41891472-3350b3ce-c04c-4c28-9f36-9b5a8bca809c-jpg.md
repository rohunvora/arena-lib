## Soft Gradient Clarity

## Essence
Clean, approachable design that uses gentle gradients and soft shadows to create depth and separation, emphasizing clarity and ease of use.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #f8f8f8, #ffffff); /* Very subtle gradient */

/* Containers */
border-radius: 24px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.04); /* Soft shadow */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Soft shadows and rounded corners on all containers create a sense of depth and consistency. */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 48px
    - h2: 32px
    - body: 16px
    - labels: 14px
- Weight usage: Bold for headings, regular for body text, medium for key labels.
- Distinctive moves: None beyond standard capitalization.
- Color treatment: Dark gray for primary text, lighter gray for secondary text/descriptions.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: Very light gray to white gradient.
- Text: Dark gray (#333 or similar) for headings and primary content, medium gray (#666 or similar) for descriptions and secondary text.
- Accent: Dark olive green/brown (#544B3A) for interactive elements like buttons and navigation.
- The rule: Color is used sparingly, with the olive green/brown providing clear visual cues for actions.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 24px
- Gap between elements: 16px between text elements, 24px between cards/sections.
- Chunking strategy: Content is grouped into cards with clear headings and descriptions.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Horizontal navigation bar at the top with olive green/brown text for active states and links.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle with a solid olive green/brown fill and white text. `border-radius: 24px;`
- **Cards**: Containers with a white background, rounded corners, and soft shadows.
- **Data display**: Descriptive labels with concise text descriptions.
- **Icons**: Simple, outlined icons (not visible in detail, but implied by the placeholder).

## Use This When
- SaaS product landing pages: The clean, approachable design is ideal for showcasing software features and benefits.
- User onboarding flows: The clear visual hierarchy and concise text make it easy for users to understand new concepts.
- Marketing websites: The soft gradients and shadows create a sense of trust and professionalism.
- When you need to feel modern but not aggressive.

## Avoid This When
- Data-dense dashboards: This style is not optimized for displaying large amounts of information.
- Highly technical documentation: The focus on aesthetics may distract from the technical content.
- When strong, vibrant branding is needed: This style is relatively muted and may not be suitable for brands that want to make a bold statement.
- When you need a very "loud" or impactful visual style.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Increase information density by using smaller font sizes and tighter spacing.
- Use a more neutral color palette with a stronger accent color for key metrics.
- Add data visualizations such as charts and graphs.

### → Landing Page
- Incorporate larger, more impactful imagery.
- Use bolder typography for headlines and calls to action.
- Add social proof elements such as testimonials and case studies.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- Mobile: Stack cards vertically, increase touch target sizes, and move navigation to a bottom tab bar.
- Web: Utilize horizontal space for wider layouts and more detailed information displays.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert background and text colors (e.g., dark gray background, white text).
- Adjust shadow values to be lighter or remove them entirely to maintain clarity.
- Keep the olive green/brown accent color consistent for key interactive elements.
