## Dark Crypto Clarity

## Essence
A dark mode interface with a focus on clear data presentation using a muted color palette and subtle visual cues for depth.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment
```css
/* Background */
background: #121212; /* Dark gray background */

/* Containers */
border-radius: 12px;
box-shadow: 0 2px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); /* Subtle shadow for depth */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent border-radius and shadow create a cohesive feel across elements */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif (clean and modern)
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 18px
    - body: 14px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for headings and important numbers, regular for body text and labels.
- Distinctive moves: None observed.
- Color treatment:
    - Primary: White (#FFFFFF)
    - Secondary: Light gray (#BDBDBD)
    - Muted: Darker gray (#616161)

### Color Logic
- Mode: Dark
- Background: #121212
- Text: Primary: #FFFFFF, Secondary: #BDBDBD
- Accent: Varied bright colors (pink, purple, blue, green, orange) to represent different categories/data points. Used in the chart and sparingly elsewhere.
- The rule: Color is used to highlight key data points and create visual interest without overwhelming the user.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px
- Gap between elements: 8px-16px
- Chunking strategy: Information is grouped into distinct sections with clear headings and consistent spacing.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Top bar with project logo/name and search icon. Horizontal scrolling tabs for date selection.
- **Buttons**: Not applicable in the visible portion.
- **Cards**: Data is presented in card-like sections with a title, primary metric, and supporting information.
- **Data display**: Large, bold numbers for primary metrics. Percentage changes are displayed with a small triangle icon and appropriate color (green for positive, red for negative).
- **Icons**: Simple, outlined icons.

## Use This When
- **Data dashboards for crypto or finance**: The dark mode and clear typography are well-suited for displaying complex data.
- **Apps targeting a younger, tech-savvy audience**: The modern aesthetic and bright accent colors will appeal to this demographic.
- **Any application where visual clarity is paramount**: The focus on typography and spacing ensures that information is easy to read and understand.
- **To evoke a sense of sophistication and modernity**: The dark mode and clean lines create a sleek and contemporary feel.

## Avoid This When
- **Applications requiring high contrast**: The dark mode may not be suitable for users with visual impairments.
- **Content-heavy applications**: The design may feel too minimalist for applications with a lot of text or images.
- **UIs that need to feel warm and inviting**: Dark mode can sometimes feel cold and impersonal.
- **When a bright, airy, or playful feel is desired**: The dark palette is inherently serious.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Increase the size of data visualizations.
- Add more detailed tooltips and interactions for data exploration.
- Implement filtering and sorting options for tables and lists.

### → Landing Page
- Replace the data chart with a hero image or video.
- Add prominent call-to-action buttons.
- Use more descriptive headings and body text.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Move navigation to a bottom tab bar. Increase touch target sizes to at least 44px.
- **Web**: Utilize a wider layout. Add more detailed data tables and visualizations.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Change the background to white (#FFFFFF).
- Change the primary text color to black (#000000).
- Change the secondary text color to dark gray (#616161).
- Reduce the opacity of shadows to make them less prominent.
- Keep the accent colors the same, but ensure they have sufficient contrast against the light background.
