## Glassmorphic Vista

## Essence
The design uses a blurred background and translucent cards to create a sense of depth and immersion, allowing content to "float" on the background.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: url([your background image URL]);
background-size: cover;
background-position: center;
filter: blur(20px); /* Adjust for desired blur */

/* Containers */
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3); /* Frosted glass effect */
border-radius: 24px;
box-shadow: 0 8px 32px 0 rgba(31, 38, 135, 0.17); /* Subtle shadow */
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.18); /* Optional subtle border */
backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* Further enhances the glass effect */

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Unified by consistent border-radius, background transparency, and the subtle shadow on all containers */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale: h1: 24px, h2: 18px, body: 14px, labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for titles, regular for body text and labels
- Distinctive moves: None apparent
- Color treatment: Primary text is dark grey, secondary text is lighter grey.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: Background image (nature scene)
- Text:
  - Primary: #333333 (dark grey)
  - Secondary: #777777 (medium grey)
- Accent: #1976D2 (blue) - used for toggle switch and potentially other interactive elements
- The rule: Color creates hierarchy through contrast, with the blue accent highlighting interactive elements.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 16px
- Gap between elements: 16px
- Chunking strategy: Content is grouped into cards with rounded corners, creating visually distinct sections.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Top-right has text labels for "Dashboard" and "Rooms". Bottom nav uses circular avatars.
- **Buttons**: Toggle switch with rounded ends.
- **Cards**: White frosted glass cards with rounded corners.
- **Data display**: Numbers displayed within cards, often accompanied by small icons or avatars.
- **Icons**: Thin, outlined icons.

## Use This When
- **Team Collaboration Tools**: The frosted glass effect creates a sense of transparency and openness, fitting for collaborative environments.
- **Minimalist Dashboards**: The clean layout and subtle visual effects keep the focus on the content.
- **Relaxed/Friendly UI**: The background image and soft shadows evoke a calm and inviting atmosphere.

## Avoid This When
- **Data-Dense Applications**: The frosted glass effect can reduce readability, especially with large amounts of text or complex data visualizations.
- **High-Contrast Requirements**: Users with visual impairments may find the low contrast between elements challenging.
- **Serious/Professional Contexts**: The playful nature of the glassmorphism might not be appropriate for all applications.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Increase contrast for data elements (charts, graphs).
- Use a less busy background image to improve readability.

### → Landing Page
- Use the accent color more prominently to draw attention to calls to action.
- Add more visual hierarchy to guide the user through the page.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Stack cards vertically and simplify the navigation. Increase touch target sizes.
- **Web**: Utilize the available screen space to display more information and provide more context.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert the text colors (primary becomes light, secondary becomes dark).
- Reduce the opacity of the frosted glass to maintain contrast.
- Ensure the background image is still visible and appropriate in dark mode.
