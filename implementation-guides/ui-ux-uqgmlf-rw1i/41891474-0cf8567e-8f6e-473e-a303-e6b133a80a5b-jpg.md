## Winter Cityscape

## Essence
A calming, sophisticated landing page style that leverages a beautiful background image and subtle UI elements to create a sense of wonder and professionalism.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: url([URL of a winter cityscape image]);
background-size: cover;
background-position: center;

/* Containers (for the top nav and main content area) */
border-radius: 12px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); /* Subtle shadow */
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); /* Optional, very subtle border */
backdrop-filter: blur(10px); /* Glass effect */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Nunito)
- Size scale:
    - h1: 48px
    - h2: 32px
    - body: 16px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for headings, regular for body, medium for important labels.
- Distinctive moves: All-caps labels for navigation items.
- Color treatment: White or very light gray for primary text, slightly muted gray for secondary text.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: Translucent with backdrop blur (derived from the background image)
- Text:
    - Primary: #FFFFFF (White)
    - Secondary: #E5E7EB (Light Gray)
- Accent: Subtle, use a light, desaturated blue or purple derived from the cityscape image. Apply only to the "Get Cofounder" button and hover states.
- The rule: Color creates hierarchy through contrast and restraint, allowing the background image to dominate.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px
- Container padding: 24px
- Gap between elements: 16px
- Chunking strategy: Simple top navigation and a prominent main content area.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Horizontal navigation bar at the top right with all-caps labels.
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle shape with a subtle background color (accent color).
- **Cards**: Not directly used, but the main content area behaves like a card with rounded corners and a shadow.
- **Data display**: N/A
- **Icons**: N/A

## Use This When
- **Landing pages for tech companies**: Conveys innovation and sophistication.
- **Websites with strong visual assets**:  Allows the imagery to take center stage.
- **Products aiming for a calming and professional feel**: The light mode and subtle effects create a sense of trust.

## Avoid This When
- **Data-heavy applications**: The focus on imagery can be distracting.
- **Websites requiring high contrast**: The light text on a potentially light background might not be accessible.
- **Designs needing a strong call to action**: The subtle color palette might not draw enough attention to key buttons.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Reduce the background image size or use a blurred version as a subtle backdrop.
- Increase the contrast of text and elements for better readability.
- Use cards with clear borders and shadows to separate data sections.

### → Landing Page
- Add more prominent calls to action with brighter accent colors.
- Incorporate more engaging animations or transitions to capture attention.
- Use a hero section with a clear value proposition.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Stack navigation items vertically in a hamburger menu. Reduce the size of the background image to improve loading times.
- **Web**: Utilize the full width of the screen for the background image. Keep the navigation horizontal.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert text colors to dark grays or blacks.
- Use a dark, desaturated version of the cityscape image as the background.
- Increase the shadow intensity to maintain a sense of depth.
- Reduce the blur on the backdrop filter to maintain legibility.
