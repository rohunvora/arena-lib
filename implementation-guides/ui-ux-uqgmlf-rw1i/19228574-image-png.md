## Pastel Metrics Blocks

## Essence
Data is presented in easily digestible chunks using a light, colorful, and rounded aesthetic.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: #F9F9F9; /* Very light gray */

/* Containers */  
border-radius: 24px;
box-shadow: none; /* No shadow */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent border radius, light background, minimal shadows */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale: 
    - h1: 32px
    - h2: 20px
    - body: 16px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for primary metrics, regular for labels and descriptions.
- Distinctive moves: None
- Color treatment: Dark gray for primary text, lighter gray for labels.

### Color Logic
- Mode: light
- Background: #F9F9F9
- Text: Primary - #333333, Secondary - #888888
- Accent: Varied pastel colors (red, purple, green, etc.). Used as background fills for metric blocks.
- The rule: Color is used to visually separate distinct metrics, not to indicate importance or state.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 24px
- Gap between elements: 16px between blocks.
- Chunking strategy: Each metric is contained within its own colored block, with a label above the metric value.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Top bar with profile icons, a plus button, and a dropdown arrow.
- **Buttons**: The plus button is a white circle with a light gray border and a black plus icon.
- **Cards**: Rounded rectangle containers with a pastel background and no border or shadow.
- **Data display**: Large, bold numbers with a descriptive label above.
- **Icons**: Simple, filled icons in a light gray color.

## Use This When
- **Personal Finance Apps**: The light and friendly aesthetic is inviting for managing personal finances.
- **Simple Data Visualization**: When presenting a small number of key metrics.
- **Beginner-Friendly Interfaces**: The clear layout and minimal design make it easy to understand.
- **Positive Emotional Tone**: The pastel colors and soft shapes evoke a sense of calm and optimism.

## Avoid This When
- **Complex Dashboards**: The lack of visual hierarchy makes it difficult to process large amounts of data.
- **Data-Intensive Applications**: Not suitable for applications requiring detailed data analysis.
- **Dark Mode Requirements**: The pastel colors may not translate well to a dark mode.
- **Serious/Professional Contexts**: The playful aesthetic may not be appropriate for all industries.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Use a more structured grid layout.
- Add subtle shadows to cards for depth.
- Use a more limited color palette for consistency.
- Introduce charts and graphs for data visualization.

### → Landing Page
- Use larger typography for headlines.
- Add a call to action button within each metric block.
- Use bolder colors to draw attention.
- Incorporate imagery to enhance the visual appeal.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Stack metric blocks vertically, increase touch target sizes to 44px.
- **Web**: Use a multi-column layout for metric blocks, consider adding hover effects.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert background to a dark gray (#222222).
- Invert text colors to white or light gray.
- Keep the pastel colors for the metric block backgrounds, but adjust their brightness to maintain contrast.
- Remove any shadows to prevent them from appearing as light halos.
