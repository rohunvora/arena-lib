## Habitual Minimalism

## Essence
Clean, minimal UI that emphasizes consistency and progress tracking through a simple, visually engaging layout.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: #F7F6F2; /* Light, warm gray */

/* Containers */  
border-radius: 24px;
box-shadow: 0px 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06); /* Subtle shadow */
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent border-radius and shadow across containers */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Geometric sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 20px
    - body: 16px
    - labels: 12px
- Weight usage: Bold for primary numbers/titles, regular for body text and labels.
- Distinctive moves: Underlining of key words in the main text.
- Color treatment: Dark gray for primary text, slightly lighter gray for secondary text.

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: #F7F6F2
- Text: #212529 (primary), #6c757d (secondary)
- Accent: #A352CC (Purple) - used for progress indicators, underlines, and small details.
- The rule: Purple highlights progress and important data, while grayscale provides a clean backdrop.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Balanced
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base
- Container padding: 24px
- Gap between elements: 16px
- Chunking strategy: Clear sections separated by whitespace and subtle shadows.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Top-right corner action icons (upload, more options, close).
- **Buttons**: Icon-only buttons with circular background.
- **Cards**: Rounded rectangles with subtle shadows.
- **Data display**:
    - Large, bold numbers for key metrics with descriptive labels below.
    - Calendar-style grid for habit tracking, using filled squares to indicate completion.
- **Icons**: Outlined.

## Use This When
- **Habit tracking apps**: The simple layout and visual progress indicators are perfect for motivating users.
- **Personal dashboards**: Easily track key metrics and progress towards goals.
- **Minimalist interfaces**: When a clean, uncluttered design is desired.
- **Positive reinforcement**: The color scheme and layout evoke a sense of accomplishment.

## Avoid This When
- **Data-heavy dashboards**: Not suitable for displaying large amounts of complex data.
- **Complex workflows**: The simplicity may not be sufficient for intricate user flows.
- **Dark mode is required**: The light background may not be ideal for low-light environments.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Use a more structured grid layout to accommodate more data.
- Add filtering and sorting options to data tables.
- Consider adding small charts and graphs to visualize trends.

### → Landing Page
- Use larger typography for headlines and calls to action.
- Incorporate more imagery and visual elements to capture attention.
- Highlight key benefits and features with concise descriptions.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- **Mobile**: Stack cards vertically, increase touch target sizes to 44px, and move navigation to a bottom tab bar.
- **Web**: Utilize a wider layout with more horizontal space, and consider adding a sidebar for navigation.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Invert the background color to a dark gray (#212529).
- Change the text color to white or a light gray (#F7F6F2).
- Keep the purple accent color consistent, but consider lightening it slightly for better contrast.
- Reduce shadow opacity or remove shadows entirely to avoid a "floating" effect.
