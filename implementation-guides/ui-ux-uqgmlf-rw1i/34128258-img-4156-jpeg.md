## Airy Mobile Canvas

## Essence
A clean, spacious design language that prioritizes clarity and approachability through generous whitespace, rounded containers, and a light, optimistic color palette.

## Key Techniques

### Surface Treatment

```css
/* Background */
background: #F9F9F9;

/* Containers */
border-radius: 24px;
box-shadow: 0px 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
border: none;

/* The cohesion recipe - what makes elements feel unified */
/* Consistent border-radius and light shadows unify elements */
```

### Typography System
- Font approach: Clean, modern sans-serif
- Size scale:
    - h1: 24px
    - h2: 20px
    - body: 16px
    - labels: 14px
- Weight usage: Bold for headings, regular for body text, medium for labels.
- Distinctive moves: None apparent.
- Color treatment: Primary text is dark gray (#333), secondary text is medium gray (#666), labels are light gray (#999).

### Color Logic
- Mode: Light
- Background: #F9F9F9 (very light gray)
- Text:
    - Primary: #333 (dark gray)
    - Secondary: #666 (medium gray)
- Accent: Blue (used minimally, likely for interactive elements)
- The rule: Color is used sparingly to guide the eye and create hierarchy, with a focus on readability.

### Layout & Spacing
- Density: Minimal - generous whitespace around elements.
- Grid/spacing unit: 8px base.
- Container padding: 24px internal padding.
- Gap between elements: 16px spacing between cards/sections.
- Chunking strategy: Information is grouped into cards with rounded corners, creating visual separation.

### Component Patterns
- **Navigation**: Top-aligned actions (notification, add)
- **Buttons**: Rounded rectangle with no fill, dark gray text, subtle border when active.
- **Cards**: Rounded corners, light shadow, content aligned to the left.
- **Data display**: Not applicable
- **Icons**: Outlined, medium weight.

## Use This When
- Personal productivity apps: The clean design promotes focus.
- Apps requiring approachability: The light colors and generous spacing create a welcoming feel.
- Mobile-first applications: The layout is well-suited for smaller screens.
- Information that is not highly time-sensitive, or where users spend shorter periods of time.

## Avoid This When
- Data-heavy dashboards: The spacious layout might not be efficient for displaying large amounts of data.
- Complex enterprise applications: The simple design might lack the necessary visual cues for complex workflows.
- Dark mode is required. The light color palette is fundamental to the design.

## Adaptation Recipes

### → Dashboard
- Reduce padding and spacing to increase information density.
- Use a more structured grid layout.
- Introduce more visual cues for data visualization (charts, graphs).

### → Landing Page
- Increase the prominence of the accent color to draw attention to key calls to action.
- Use larger, more visually appealing images.
- Add more whitespace to create a sense of luxury.

### → Mobile ↔ Web
- Mobile: Stack cards vertically, increase touch target sizes to at least 44px.
- Web: Use a multi-column layout to take advantage of the larger screen size.

### → Invert Color Mode
- Background: Change to a dark gray (#222).
- Text: Invert primary and secondary text colors to light gray (#ddd) and medium gray (#999) respectively.
- Shadows: Remove shadows or use very subtle, dark shadows.
- Accent color: Ensure the accent color has sufficient contrast against the dark background.
